bug: 
- big value x: solved --> no space to stock x in 64-bit fixed point form
- small value x: diff = 1 (binary form) --> function toFixedPoint(float x) takes e (expo) as an attribute, in case of e>63, operation shift doesnt work correctly

Diff result on diff pc -> WTF?
Working on improve performance of multiplication.
Using option -O3 makes program run faster but libc run slower --> WTF?
